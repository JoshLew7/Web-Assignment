                    <p>Hey, my name is Joshua Lewis. I am 19 years old and was born and raised in a small town
                        called Saint Rose, Louisiana. I completed the majority of my schooling in Louisiana,
                        but in my senior year of high school, I moved to Heath, Texas. I think this move fits
                        my personality as I love meeting new people and making new memories!</p>
                </div>
                <div class="what">
                    <h3> What I <span class="text-primary"> Do? </span></h3>
                    <p>I am currently a rising sophomore Computer Science major at Xavier University of
                        Louisiana and am expected to graduate in May of 2023! I am a software mentor for a
                        local FRC (Robotics) Team in my community as well as a tutor for some of my peers at
                        Xavier. Also I am currently working at Google this summer as a STEP intern which is
                        one of the things I am most proud of!
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="why">
                    <h3>Why I <span class="text-primary"> do it?</span> </h3>
                    <p>I got into computer science because of Robotics during my freshman year of high-school
                        and from that point on I've been obsessed with it. Seeing the code that I write
                        affect a robot was something that never got old. My goal as I get further into my
                        career is to work in the robotics health industry or the autonomous vehicle industry.
                        This is because those are areas where a lot of people can be positively affected as well
                        as an area that I truly enjoy working in. My ultimate dream is to one day own my own company!

                    <p>PokeHood is a program that I designed along with two other partners for my Google CSSI final project.
                        Designed in Processing Python, PokeHood has most of the basic features that would be present in an old
                        pokemon game. For the project, I designed all of the in-game mechanics such as the world with character
                        movements/animation and player to pokemon detection to initiate the battles. I also designed the battle
                        screen logic such as type effectiveness and damage calculation.
